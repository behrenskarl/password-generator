# Description

This was the hardest homework yet and I wouldn't have been able to complete it without assistance from classmates and a private tutoring session with a friend who is a professional developer. The layers of functions and loops was what really tripped me up and I'll have to get better at psuedo coding to keep myself organized in the future. It was also tough to understand when to use what syntax and semantics in js. Not sure when something should be a var "variable" or an array but my friend helped me clean all that up. I also must admit I researched it online and read about the shuffle array function that scrmables the code randomly but would've never been able to understand and implement that without the help of that tutoring session since it was not covered in class but was not sure how else to achieve that desired outcome for the assignment. Though it functions great and looks great, I have much work and practice to get to the point where I could put this together on my own in the matter of one week...
